3,Inclusion at Codeup During Pride Month (and Always) - Codeup,"Inclusion at Codeup During Pride Month (and Always)
Jun 1, 2022 | Codeup News


Happy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.
Cultivating Inclusive Growth
We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.
In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively.
Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.
Codeup Initiatives
To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students.
Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. 
Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.
If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now. Then, apply for our Pride Scholarship."
4,Mental Health First Aid Training - Codeup,"Mental Health First Aid Training
May 31, 2022 | Tips for Prospective Students


As a student of Codeup, going through a massive career transition can be mentally taxing. Did you know that members of our student-facing staff and human resources team are trained in Mental Health First Aid? Let’s dive into what that means for Codeup! 
Mental Health First Aid Training 
Some of our Codeup staff that works directly with our students are trained in Mental Health First Aid. This includes members of our student experience team, career coaches, and the human resources department. This training was courtesy of the Center for Health Care Services in San Antonio. They graciously provided the funding and training for our team in this pilot training program. 
What is Mental Health First Aid? According to mentalhhealthfirstaid.org, “is a course that teaches you how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. The training gives you the skills you need to reach out and provide initial help and support to someone who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem or experiencing a crisis”.
To be clear, our staff are not licensed, mental health professionals. What MHFA equips our staff with are tools to gauge risk and connect students and staff with the help they might need. This might include recognizing something in a meeting, picking up on cues during a casual conversation, or acting on a pattern behavior. 
How does this help our students?
Many who go through Codeup’s programs will tell you it is both rewarding and challenging all at the same time. Some students have compared learning at Codeup to  “drinking from a firehouse”. You learn so much at once, so fast. This style of learning if you are not used to it can be taxing on anyone’s mental fortitude. This allows our staff who work closely with the students to be able to identify if a student is in need of mental health help. 
Consider Your Career Change Today
Why does this skill set matter? You! We’re here to support your career transition as best we can, and Mental Health First Aid training is just one small piece of that larger support effort. Learn more about how we can support your career transition by applying today."
